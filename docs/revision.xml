  <para>
   The attribute <sgmltag>revisionflag</sgmltag> is usefull to identify the changes between two revisions of a document. This information is managed by dblatex, that adds revision bars in the margin of the paragraphs changed, such like in this <phrase revisionflag="changed">paragraph</phrase>.

   Adding the revision flags can be manual, but its is tedious and error prone. The perl script <ulink url="http://www.sun.com/xml/developers/diffmk/">diffmk</ulink> by Norman Walsh can do the work for you. It works fine, but it depends on several Perl modules.

<note><para>
With old changebar packages the revision bars only appear when using the "dvips"
driver. This limitation has been fixed with changebar greater or equal 
to v3.5c.
