    <title>Description</title>
    <para>These Processing Instructions are unusual in that they have no
    <quote>attribute</quote>. Instead, the
    <replaceable>content</replaceable> is put directly into the
    generated LaTeX document.</para>

    <para>The <package>db2latex</package> PI is deprecated and should not
    be used anymore. It was provided for backward compatibility. Use the
    <package>latex</package> PI instead.</para>

    <para>This can provide the ultimate in customization, but can be
    very dangerous since it breaks the abstractions provided by
    dblatex.</para>

    <warning>
      <para>These Processing Instructions can be used
      to inject arbitrary LaTeX into the output stream. Please check if a
      safer customization method can be used instead. See the other
      <link linkend="sec-custom">customization methods</link>.</para>

      <para>While it is pretty clear that insertion of certain sorts
      of LaTeX text, at some points within the document, will always
      be expected to work, there is no guarantee that
      <emphasis>any</emphasis> inserted LaTeX will continue to work in
      the future with newer versions of dblatex or its underlying
      software stack.</para>

      <para>Inserting LaTeX into <code>CDATA</code>, i.e. in places
      where document text appears, is likely to be more robust than
      inserting LaTeX elsewhere.  But again, no guarantees are
      made.</para>
    </warning>

    <para>The <package>latex</package> Processing Instruction takes
    special steps to work in verbatim blocks,
    <sgmltag>screen</sgmltag>, <sgmltag>programlisting</sgmltag>, and
    <sgmltag>literallayout</sgmltag> elements, while
    <package>db2latex</package> is directly written as is.</para>
